is the above code everything in one file?
Copilot
Sent by Copilot:
Yes, the code provided above can be placed in a single file. However, for better organization and maintainability, itâ€™s often a good practice to split the code into multiple files based on functionality. Hereâ€™s how you can structure it:

QuestSettings.cs: For the QuestSettings class.
QuestFrequencyMod.cs: For the main mod class and settings window.
QuestLoader.cs: For the QuestLoader class.
QuestManager_Add_Patch.cs: For the Harmony patch.
Hereâ€™s how you can split the code:

QuestSettings.cs
C#

using System.Collections.Generic;
using Verse;

public class QuestSettings : ModSettings
{
    public Dictionary<string, bool> questEnabled = new Dictionary<string, bool>(); 

    public override void ExposeData() 
    {
        Scribe_Collections.Look(ref questEnabled, "questEnabled", LookMode.Value, LookMode.Value);
        base.ExposeData();
    }
}

By splitting the code into these files, you maintain a clean and organized structure, making it easier to manage and extend in the future. If you prefer to keep everything in one file, you can do so, but this approach is generally recommended for larger projects.

do the radio buttons allow more than one tech level to be selected at a time?
Copilot
Sent by Copilot:
No, the radio buttons in the provided code are designed to allow only one tech level to be selected at a time. This is the default behavior of radio buttons, which ensures that only one option from a group can be selected.

Hereâ€™s the relevant part of the code:

C#

if (listingStandard.RadioButton("Neolithic", selectedOption == "Neolithic"))
{
    selectedOption = "Neolithic";
    ApplyPatch(TechLevel.Neolithic);
}
if (listingStandard.RadioButton("Medieval", selectedOption == "Medieval"))
{
    selectedOption = "Medieval";
    ApplyPatch(TechLevel.Medieval);
}
if (listingStandard.RadioButton("Industrial", selectedOption == "Industrial"))
{
    selectedOption = "Industrial";
    ApplyPatch(TechLevel.Industrial);
}
if (listingStandard.RadioButton("All Rewards", selectedOption == "All Rewards"))
{
    selectedOption = "All Rewards";
    ApplyPatch(TechLevel.Ultra);
}
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
In this setup, selecting one radio button will automatically deselect any other radio button in the group, ensuring that only one tech level can be active at a time. If you have any more questions or need further adjustments, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š


can you describe what the entire package you just posted is doing

Copilot
Sent by Copilot:
Sure! Hereâ€™s a detailed description of what the entire package does:

Overview
This package is a mod for the game RimWorld that allows players to control the types of quests and rewards they receive based on tech levels. It provides a settings menu where players can enable or disable specific quests and select a tech level for quest rewards.

Components
QuestSettings.cs
Purpose: Manages the settings for enabling or disabling quests.
Key Functionality:
Stores a dictionary of quest names and their enabled/disabled status.
Saves and loads these settings using the ExposeData method.
QuestFrequencyMod.cs
Purpose: The main mod class that integrates the settings menu and applies Harmony patches.
Key Functionality:
Initializes the mod and applies Harmony patches.
Provides a settings window with radio buttons for selecting a tech level and checkboxes for enabling/disabling quests.
Applies a patch to the QuestGen_Rewards class to filter rewards based on the selected tech level.
Contains the GiveRewards_Prefix method to modify the reward generation parameters.
QuestLoader.cs
Purpose: Retrieves all quest definitions from the gameâ€™s database.
Key Functionality:
Provides a method GetAllQuestDefs that returns a list of all quest definitions.
QuestManager_Add_Patch.cs
Purpose: A Harmony patch that modifies the behavior of the Add method in the QuestManager class.
Key Functionality:
Intercepts the Add method to check if a quest is enabled in the settings before adding it to the quest list.
Logs messages for debugging and control.
How It Works
Initialization:
When the mod is loaded, QuestFrequencyMod initializes the settings and applies all Harmony patches.
It logs the methods of QuestManager for debugging purposes.
Settings Window:
The settings window provides radio buttons for selecting a tech level (Neolithic, Medieval, Industrial, All Rewards).
It also provides checkboxes for enabling or disabling specific quests.
The selected tech level and quest settings are saved and loaded using QuestSettings.
Applying Patches:
When a tech level is selected, the ApplyPatch method unpatches any existing patches and applies a new patch to the GiveRewards method of QuestGen_Rewards.
The GiveRewards_Prefix method modifies the reward generation parameters to filter rewards based on the selected tech level.
Quest Management:
The QuestManager_Add_Patch intercepts the Add method of QuestManager to check if a quest is enabled before adding it to the quest list.
This ensures that only enabled quests are added and managed by the QuestManager.
Summary
This mod enhances the gameplay experience by allowing players to control the types of quests and rewards they receive. It provides a user-friendly settings menu and uses Harmony patches to modify the gameâ€™s behavior based on the playerâ€™s preferences.

would changing these settings require a game restart to take effect?
Copilot
Sent by Copilot:
No, changing these settings should not require a game restart to take effect. The settings for enabling/disabling quests and selecting the tech level for rewards are applied dynamically through the Harmony patches. Hereâ€™s how it works:

Tech Level Selection: When you select a different tech level in the settings menu, the ApplyPatch method unpatches any existing patches and applies a new patch with the selected tech level. This change takes effect immediately.
Quest Enable/Disable: The settings for enabling or disabling specific quests are checked each time a quest is added to the QuestManager. This means that any changes you make in the settings menu will be applied the next time a quest is generated or added.
Since the Harmony patches and settings are applied dynamically, you should see the changes take effect without needing to restart the game. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
